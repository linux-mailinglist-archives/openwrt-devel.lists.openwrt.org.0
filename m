Call For Papers for ISI/SCOPUS/EI Compendex indexed Journals via our
conferences:

                  www.rb.gy/3v1rf2


Good News: All the papers in our Conferences will appear (after peer
review) in ISI/SCOPUS/EI Compendex indexed Journals. The registration fees
depend on the indexing of the particular Journal. We offer better APC
(Article Processing Charges / Fees) than the Web Sites of these OA
Journals, because we deliver them great numbers of papers. So, publish via
our Conferences in
ISI/SCOPUS/EI Compendex indexed Journals and present your paper using
Video Presentation to more than 1000 people.
