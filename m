Hello,

The local organization team is proud to announce that this year's
Battlemesh will be held near Paris, from 8 to 14 July!

The event aims to bring together people from across the globe who are
interested in community networks, including wireless mesh network
technologies, fiber infrastructure, Do-It-Yourself Internet Access
Providers, and more generally how to create and maintain a thriving
community of people involved in building their own networks.

We envision 7 days full of expert presentations, practical workshops,
late-night hacking sessions, and fruitful discussions: whether you are a
mesh networking enthusiast, community networking activist, protocol
developer, or have an interest in networking in general, come and join us!=

Paris).

What
=3D=3D=3D=3D

We will have organized talks, workshops and discussion panels on community
networks and wireless mesh networks.  There will also be more informal
activities: cooperative hacking, self-organized projects, and (we hope)
delightful conversations!

A first draft of the schedule (handle with care!) is available here: https:=

the organisation much easier if you tell us in advance that you plan to

We invite participants to propose workshops, talks or panel discussions
relating to network infrastructure in general, how it can be built and
operated as a common, and how to sustain a community around networking.

We welcome contributions that broadly address these questions from any of
several perspectives: technical, organisational, economical, regulatory,
juridical, political.

Deadline: 10 May 2019, now extended to June 7th!
